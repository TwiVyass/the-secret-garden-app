✨ The Secret Garden Journal ✨

For me, September feels like a gentle shift—from summer’s carefree chaos to autumn’s thoughtful calm. It’s the season of new routines, cozy corners, and quiet self-reflection.

So, I built The Secret Garden Journal, an Electron-based journaling app that turns that feeling into an interactive pixel-art sanctuary.

🔐 Vault Door Entry – Start your journaling ritual by unlocking a pixel-art vault door with a secret password.

It has three Modes of Reflection –

Guided Journey: thoughtful prompts to spark reflection
Free Writing: an open space for your thoughts
Penny for Thoughts: flip a coin for random prompts, balancing light and deep reflections
🌸 Growth Tracking – Every entry you save plants a digital flower in your garden, letting you literally watch your reflections bloom over time.

💾 Private by Design – Entries are stored locally, so your sanctuary is truly yours.

✨ How GitHub Copilot helped:

Structured my screen transitions + local storage logic
Generated diverse journaling prompts
Optimized animations for smoother performance
🎨 The result? A journaling experience that feels like September—warm tones, pixel-art coziness, quiet rituals, and the reminder that growth takes time.
